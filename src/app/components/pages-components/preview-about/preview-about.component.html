          <p class="preview-paragraph preview-intro-paragraph">My name is Mikhail and this is my blog about cybersecurity and IT. I am really obsessed with what I am doing and I want to share my knowledge with people.</p><br>
          <p class="preview-paragraph preview-intro-paragraph">The idea behind creating with blog was also quite interesting. I think that the best way to learn something is to start teach other people. Also, for me this blog is the opportunity to just write some code (which I also still like, despite the fact that I am not work as a developer anymore).</p><br>
          <p class="preview-paragraph preview-intro-paragraph">If you find anything that I am writing about interesting, you would like to talk or you have any other reasons why you want to talk to me, I will always be glad to do so. </p><br>
